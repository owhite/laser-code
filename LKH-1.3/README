LKH is an implementation of the Lin-Kernighan traveling salesman heuristic.

The code is distributed for research use. The author reserves all rights to the code.


INSTRUCTIONS FOR INSTALLATION:  (Version 1.3 - July 2002)

The software is available in two formats:

	LKH-1.3.tgz		(gzipped tar file, 5.9 MB)
	LKH-1.3.sit		(StuffIt archive, 4.6 MB)

If a UNIX machine is used, download the software in the first format. 
Next execute the following UNIX commands:

      	gzip -d LKH-1.3.tgz
      	tar xvf LKH-1.3.tar
      	cd LKH-1.3 
	make

An executable file called LKH.UNIX is now available in the directory LKH-1.3.

If a MacOSX or a Windows machine is used, download the software in the second format. 
Next unstuff it with Stuffit Expander (freeware available at http://www.aladdinsys.com). 

To test the installation run the LKH program (LKH.UNIX on a UNIX machine, LKH.MacOSX 
on a MacOSX machine and LKH.Win on a Windows machine).

The program asks for a filename

	PARAMETER_FILE =

On a UNIX machine type Par.UNIX 
On a MacOS machine type Par.Mac 
On a Windows machine type Par.Win 
Then press return.

The program should now solve a problem with 532 cities.

For further instructions, see the LKH User Guide in the DOC directory.


CHANGES IN VERSION 1.3:

The distance type GEOM has been added (see www.math.princeton.edu/tsp/world).
Additional control information may now be given in the parameter file by means 
of the following keywords:

	BACKTRACK_MOVE_TYPE
	CANDIDATE_FILE
	INITIAL_TOUR_FILE
	MAX_SWAPS
	MERGE_TOUR_FILE_1
	MERGE_TOUR_FILE_2
	RESTRICTED_SEARCH

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.2:

Execution times may be measured more accurately, if the getrusage function is 
supported by the system. See the GetTime.c file for instructions.

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.1:

The code has been made more robust regarding the solution of asymmetric problems. 
The old code (LKH-1.0, February 1999) could loose its way in some cases due to 
integer overflow.
