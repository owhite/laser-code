This is not really install documentation as it is a 
description of what you need to do to start from a clean 
linuxcnc installation live CD with Ubuntu 10.04 

If system is already installed:
 with cd in machine:
 kill /boot/grub/grub.cfg
 restart, go to grub type exit

Or if you can boot directly to the CD dont worry about it. 

Perform install from CD - long wait.

Once installed:

sudo apt-get update
system -> administration -> update manager
  update everything

go to http://trac.osgeo.org/geos/
download geos-3.3.5 source
install swig, ruby, doxygen, python-sip-dev with synaptic

./configure --enable-python --enable-swig

make
sudo make install

sudo apt-get install python-setuptools

get Shapely-1.2.16

Users should make sure libgeos_c is on the system path, and install
shapely wiht setup.py

export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib

sudo python setup.py install
sudo python setup.py test

sudo apt-get install python-pip
pip install Shapely

then run test_geos.py in laser-code to look at the versions, which examines:

> from shapely.geos import lgeos
> lgeos.geos_capi_version
> lgeos._lgeos.GEOSversion()

The above test script works if $LD_LIBRARY_PATH is set with export. I have 
a -feeling- that 

sudu /sbin/ldconfig

then made it possible for it to be permanently available to the system.

Also run: 

sudo apt-get install emacs23

------------------------------------------------------------

dont forget to install the visual basic code into the rhino directory to run that macro
